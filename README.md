# KB-Planner-Front-End
This was a group project I worked on for my senior capstone at DePaul University. We had 10 weeks to complete this. 

Front-end: Frank Lenoci, Jonah Roach ,Amber Reese. 
Back-end: Sonu Patel, Thomas Bart, Christopher Grau, Anthony Cruz.


The purpose of KB Planner is to simplify the way for University students to efficiently manage and track group student projects. Through visualization of group workflow in a simplistic manner students will be able to both see the work assigned to each student as well as incentivize students to leave feedback on accomplishments of team members. This system will also allow for Professors to easily manage and check in with student groups throughout project timelines. The goal is to improve the painstaking process for assigning and completing group projects on University sponsored websites such as D2L.
